# Frontend Mentor - Profile card component

![Design preview for the Profile card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Instructions

See [original readme](./ORIGINAL_README.md) for details about challenge.

## Initial Thoughts

This should be easy for me as the difficult level is "newbie" and I think I'm a little beyond that.

Typically I'd react by spinning up something like a Next app or CRA, but that really shouldn't be necessary here.

I suppose since it's kind of a warm up, I could just go for the most plain html/css approach possible. There doesn't seem to be much value in going overboard and deeply considering reusability and the like.

## Approach

Let's start with mobile, then proceed to the larger viewports. By the looks of the designs, the mobile version should probably work for the large viewports almost automatically.

## Browser Support

I'll support Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and iOS Safari. I would typically add Edge (and IE if I have to), but I don't have an easy way to test and it doesn't seem worth the hassle at this point.
