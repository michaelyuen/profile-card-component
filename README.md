# Frontend Mentor - Profile card component

![Design preview for the Profile card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Instructions

See [original readme](./ORIGINAL_README.md) for details about challenge.

## Initial Thoughts

This should be easy for me as the difficult level is "newbie" and I think I'm a little beyond that.

Typically I'd react by spinning up something like a Next app or CRA, but that really shouldn't be necessary here.

I suppose since it's kind of a warm up, I could just go for the most plain html/css approach possible. There doesn't seem to be much value in going overboard and deeply considering reusability and the like.

## Approach

Let's start with mobile, then proceed to the larger viewports. By the looks of the designs, the mobile version should probably work for the large viewports almost automatically.

## Browser Support

I'll support Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and iOS Safari. I would typically add Edge (and IE if I have to), but I don't have an easy way to test and it doesn't seem worth the hassle at this point.

## Remarks

Geez. Even for something that seems as simple as a plain html & css profile card there's a lot more complexity than one might expect. Lots of decisions to make. I followed an "older" approach of BEM class names as targets for styles, which felt pretty tedious for a small project like this. I could have gone even more "quick and dirty" and did most things inline but I'm not sure it would have felt better, just different. There were also moments where following a more utility-based styling approach would have been advantageous and definitely caused me to pause and consider examples I've seen from Semantic UI and Tailwind. But in the end, this is a really small project and I think whatever works is fine. Those types of considerations are more important in larger projects or when working with others; not so much here.

The image that sits behind the avatar was slightly tricky. My solution is not as dynamic as I'd like in that regard. I used a magic number that is half the background image's height for padding to make the avatar positioned as the design indicates.

I'm positive the solution is not 100% equivalent to the provided images, but without actual design assets I think this is good enough and fulfills the spirit. The most glaring difference is probably the background images and their positioning across viewports. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
